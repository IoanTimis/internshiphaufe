# Simple Node.js Product Management System

This project is a basic product management system built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **EJS**, **MySQL**, and basic front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The project allows different types of users (admin, clients, and sellers) to interact with products in various ways.

## Features

### Admin Panel:
- Admins can view, search, edit, and delete users.
- Admins can also manage all products (search, edit, and delete).
- Filtering products by price and searching by name.

### Seller Account:
- Sellers can create their own accounts.
- Sellers can add, edit, and delete their own products.

### User Account:
- Users can view a list of products and "buy" products (which adds them to the purchase history).
- Users can view their purchase history, although no actual cart or purchase functionality is implemented.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js** - Backend runtime environment.
- **Express.js** - Web framework for Node.js.
- **EJS** - Templating engine for rendering HTML views.
- **MySQL** - Relational database used for storing users and products.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - For front-end rendering.
- **Session Management** - To manage user sessions and login states.
